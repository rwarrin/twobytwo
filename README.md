# TwoByTwo

An app for organizing a todo list. Tasks are organized into one of four buckets
Urgent and Important (1), Urgent but Not Important (2), Not Urgent but Important
(3), Not Urgent and Not Important (4).

```
  IMPORTANT
  +---+---+
U | 1 | 2 |
R |   |   |
G +---+---+
E | 3 | 4 |
N |   |   |
T +---+---+
```

Tasks can be reordered and moved between lists. Task lists can be saved and
loaded. Saved lists are autosaved every 5 minutes.
